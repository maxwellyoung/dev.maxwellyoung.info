## HIGH FIT (Worth real effort)

### Tier 1: Strong Profile Match

- Apply: SEEK listing active

**Sharesies** - Investment platform

### Tier 2: Worth a Shot

**Xero** - Accounting software (the big one)

- Apply: Direct application

**Alimetry** - Health tech (GI diagnostics)

## DESIGN STUDIOS (Alternative path)

Good for building portfolio, learning client work, less stable.

**Psychoactive Studios**
- Award-winning, Webflow/React/WebGL
- Offices: Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch
- Why fit: They do the exact work you do
- Risk: Agency life = deadlines, varied quality clients

**Koda**
- B2B React apps, ERP integrations
- Why fit: Serious technical work, not marketing fluff
- Risk: B2B can be boring

**Roam Creative**
- Digital product studio, Fortune 500 to startups
- Why fit: Variety, product focus
- Risk: Might be more strategy than building

**Theta**
- Tech consultancy, Auckland/Wellington/Christchurch
- Why fit: Established, varied projects
- Risk: Consulting = context switching

## REMOTE-FRIENDLY (International)

Your profile works for remote roles. Worth parallel tracking.

**Vercel** - Next.js creators
- They hire globally, you literally use their stack
- Super competitive but worth a shot

**Linear** - Project management
- Design-led, anti-bloat philosophy
- Matches your values exactly
- Small team, high bar

**Raycast** - Productivity tool
- Design-forward, keyboard-first
- Aligns with your "software that shuts up" thesis

**Basecamp / 37signals** - Project management
- Famous for anti-growth stance
- They hire globally, rarely

**Notion** - Knowledge tools
- Design-led, but very large now
- Still worth considering

---

## AVOID (Time wasters for your profile)

- **Growth-stage adtech** - Direct conflict with your values
- **Pure marketing agencies** - You'd hate the work
- **Very early startups (<5 people)** - Unless equity is real and meaningful
- **Large banks/insurance** - Too slow, too corporate
- **Outsourcing shops** - Race to the bottom

---

## APPLICATION STRATEGY

### Volume targets
- 60% tailored (15-20 companies from High Fit)
- 30% semi-tailored (studios, remote roles)
- 10% spray (job boards, see what sticks)

### Tailoring checklist
1. Research their product - use it if possible
2. Find one thing that's broken or could be better
3. Reference it specifically in cover letter
4. Link directly to relevant case study (Spark for data-heavy, VQC for mobile)

### Outreach order
1. Check if you know anyone there (LinkedIn second-degree)
2. Find the hiring manager, DM directly
3. Apply through careers page
4. Job boards as last resort

### Resume version
- Use ATS version for job boards
- Use standard version for direct/referral applications
